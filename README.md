# My C Programs

A collection of small C programs I wrote to practice basics like:
- Printing to console
- Using loops and conditionals
- Working with arrays and functions
- Handling files

## Projects
- `hello.c` – Prints "Hello, World!"
- `arrays/` – Array operations examples
- `file_handling/` – Read/write files in C
